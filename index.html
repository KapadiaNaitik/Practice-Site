        <h2 class="quote">“I’ve learned how vital it is to create a strong company foundation, implement proper processes and concurrently, and respectfully, involve people right from the start – without this, executives and projects are vulnerable.”</h2>
        <p class="para">A hands-on senior executive, Ineke has over 25 years’ telecoms experience at CXO, CEO and at Board
            level and has succeeded where many would have thrown in the towel. Physical risk, natural disaster,
            and malpractice have been regular challenges for Ineke, who has a ‘focus forward’ approach to her
            work. 
        </p>
        <p class="para"> Tolerance, determination and tenacity characterise this Dutch national and are traits that have
            helped her deliver significant revenue successes in some of the world’s most troubled spots.</p>
        <p class="para">Ineke transfers knowledge from complex postings in Ukraine, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Kosovo,
            Lebanon, Azerbaijan, Haiti and Western Europe. She has used her business development and
            management skills to establish and lead a number of telecom operations.</p>

            </span>
           
        <p class="para para2">Her expertise and experience of network building, swaps and optimisation is of significant value to
            those entering the telecoms and mobile telecoms sectors. Her knowledge of revenue management
            through effective distribution network optimisation is also in high demand.</p>
            
        <p class="para para2">Ineke says transparency, diplomacy and cultural sensitivity are indispensable skills that need to
            complement academic knowledge in order to achieve broad and long-lasting success: “In complex
            and challenging situations, only well-prepared executives with the right attitude and approach to risk
            will produce successful and rewarding businesses.”</p>

                    <h2 class="quote">“Keeping your personal radar on full, all the time, helps managers better understand situations, adapt accordingly and balance business objectives with local sensitivities.”</h2>
                    <p class="para">Gavin has worked in some of the most politically-charged countries in the world including
                        Afghanistan, Kosovo, Pakistan, Latvia, Papua New Guinea, Russia and Malawi - and often at times of
                         conflict or post-conflict recovery.</p>
                    <p class="para"> His 25 year plus exposure as a CEO and CFO in mobile and fixed telecoms has given him a wealth of
                        experience that he shares with clients charged with new challenges such as start-ups and change
                        management projects.</p>
                    <p class="para">Enabling others to make a lasting difference is where he believes Wyze2 adds real value: “Being
                        faced with the unknown can make for ineffective leadership; we help executives understand how
                        they can thrive in alien environments by listening, analysing the risks carefully, reading situations
                        accurately and understanding what’s important.”</p>

                    <p class="para para2">Gavin has first-hand experience of physical, political and corruption challenges where they have the
                        potential to seriously impact or even close down operations. He helps clients make well-informed
                        pre-entry risk decisions by sharing his knowledge of how threats can manifest themselves and
                        impact investment plans.</p>
                    <p class="para para2"> Resourcefulness, awareness and recognition of local motivations and abilities are skills Gavin has
                                applied to many international appointments. He believes greater individual and project resilience
                                can be built when executives learn how to interpret early information and build useful risk profiles.</p>
